//! The wire contract: the guard, and the handler bodies behind it.

//! This is the module's public surface (PLAN.md §2.5) — every method takes JSON
//! and returns JSON, and failure is always `{"error":"..."}`. The forum's
//! semantics live in the sibling modules; this one is the boundary they are
//! reached through.
//!
//! Phase 0 wrote this as `core.rs` inside the module crate, against the day it
//! would become the pure inner crate PLAN.md §9 describes. That day is this
//! commit, and the seam held: the move was a rename, not a rewrite.

/// cannot read the environment or know the host's persistence path, and a probe
/// that went looking would be doing discovery at a moment its caller does not
/// control — the adapter has both and passes them in. The `stoa` is needed
/// because there is no such thing as "the" identity: §5.2 gives a user one
/// identity *per Stoa*, so "who would post" has no answer until a Stoa is
/// named.
///
/// # `Fn`, not `FnOnce`
///
/// The spec says the probe is callable repeatedly — a view asks it whenever it
/// renders, not once per process. Review flagged `FnOnce` as making that
/// scenario unsatisfiable.
///
/// **That turned out to be half right, and the correction is worth recording
/// because the obvious reading is wrong.** `FnOnce` is a supertrait of `Fn`,
/// so a `&F` where `F: Fn` satisfies it — the repeatability scenario *was*
/// testable under `FnOnce`, by passing a reference. Verified by reverting the
/// signature and watching the test still pass, twice, including with a
/// capturing closure.
///
/// `Fn` stays because it is the **honest** constraint rather than the minimum
/// one: nothing here consumes the lookup, `FnOnce` said it might, and a caller
/// reading the signature would reasonably conclude it had to build a fresh
/// closure per call. A signature that overstates what it takes is a signature
/// callers work around.
